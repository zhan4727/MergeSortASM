# MergeSortASM
Merge Sort implemented in x86-64 assembly language.

## Testing
Run `gcc -o merge_sort_asm merge_sort.s test_mergesort.c` and `./merge_sort_asm` to test the assembly program.

## Comparison with C Program
Run `gcc -o merge_sort merge_sort.c` and `./merge_sort` to see the output of the C program. The output should be same as that of the assembly program.
